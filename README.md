 // Hamster Hotel

 // Made a website based off of the prototype given with given assets and Bootstrap

 // Peer Reviewer: Jesus Lares 

 // Review Notes:  This website looks close to 1/1 to the actual website like 98%. only issue i see,  is the the middle card is not aligned correctly should fix that, and also below welcome to paradise you should give it a line spacing and thats pretty much it. Awesome leo, great job!
